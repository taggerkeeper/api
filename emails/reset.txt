Hello!

Someone (hopefully you!) asked us to reset the password for your Tagger Keeper user account. If you’d still like to, you can do so by going to this URL:

https://taggerkeeper.com/reset/[RESETCODE]

If you weren’t expecting this email, it’s possibly that someone’s up to something. If you’re reading this, they probably haven’t succeeded. All we have is an IP address ([IPADDR]). IP addresses can be manipulated pretty easily, so you shouldn’t put too much faith in what they reveal, but it could be a hint as to what’s going on if this is a mystery. You can visit the URL below to learn more about this IP address.
