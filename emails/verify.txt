Hello!

Someone (hopefully you!) just added this email address ([EMAILADDR]) to a Tagger Keeper user account. To make sure that we’ve got it right, can you verify that this really is your email address for us by going to this URL?

If you weren’t expecting this email, it’s possible that someone’s up to something. If you’re reading this, they probably haven’t succeeded. All we have is an IP address ([IPADDR]). IP addresses can be manipulated pretty easily, so you shouldn’t put too much faith in what they reveal, but it could be a hint as to what’s going on if this is a mystery. You can visit the URL below to learn more about this IP address.
