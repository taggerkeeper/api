Hello!

Someone (hopefully you!) asked us to reset the password for a Tagger Keeper user account with this email address ([EMAILADDR]). We don’t have any record of a user account with that email, though. If you sent this request, you can try a different email address.

If you weren’t expecting this email, it’s possibly that someone’s up to something. If you’re reading this, they probably haven’t succeeded. All we have is an IP address ([IPADDR]). IP addresses can be manipulated pretty easily, so you shouldn’t put too much faith in what they reveal, but it could be a hint as to what’s going on if this is a mystery. You can visit the URL below to learn more about this IP address.
